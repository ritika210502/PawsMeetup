# PawsMeetup
## Introduction
PawsMeetup is a web application designed to help dog owners find and connect with other dogs for socialization, playdates, and potential breeding. The platform allows users to create profiles for their dogs, match them with similar dogs based on various criteria, and start conversations to arrange playdates or breedings.

## Features
 -Dog Profile Management: Users can create and update profiles for their dogs, including details such as breed, age, size, temperament, and energy level.
 -AI-Powered Dog Matching: The platform uses an AI-based matching algorithm to recommend suitable dogs for breeding or playdates.
 -Messaging System: Chat functionality enables users to communicate with other dog owners to arrange meetups.
 -User Authentication: Secure registration and login system for dog owners.
 -Responsive Design: Fully responsive frontend to ensure smooth experience across various devices.
## Tech Stack
### Backend: Django, Django REST Framework
### Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
### Database: MySQL
### AI: Python for machine learning-based dog matching (using criteria like breed, size, energy level)

## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Django 4.2+
MySQL

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PawsMeetup.git
  cd PawsMeetup
2. Set up the Backend (Django):
    -Create a virtual environment:
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3.Install the required dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  Set up the database: Ensure MySQL is installed and running. Create a database for your project in MySQL:
    CREATE DATABASE pawsmeetup;
4.Configure database settings in pawsmeetup/settings.py:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': 'pawsmeetup',
            'USER': 'your_db_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '3306',
        }
    }
5.Apply migrations:
  python manage.py migrate
6.Create a superuser for admin access:
  python manage.py createsuperuser

7. Run the Django Development Server:
  python manage.py runserver
  Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the app.

## Additional Notes:
### AI Matching: 
The AI-based dog matching algorithm is based on criteria such as breed, size, energy level, and temperament. For this feature, consider using basic machine learning models like decision trees or k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for simplicity, or integrate pre-trained models if accuracy is not the primary focus.
